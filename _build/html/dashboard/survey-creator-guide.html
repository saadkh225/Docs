<h1>2. SURVEY CREATOR GUIDE<a class="headerlink" href="#survey-creator-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<img alt="../_images/img4.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img4.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Survey creator is the tool where all the surveys are scripted as per the questionnaire and the requirement of an individual/organization. It has following primary components:</div>
</div>
<p><strong>1. SECTION SELECTOR</strong></p>
<p><em>Every study/survey has four main sections: Questions, Lists, Media and Langauges</em></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QUESTIONS</span></tt>: This is the section where all the questions are added in a study and the kind of representation of each question as per requirement is implemented in this section.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LISTS</span></tt>: Answer choices belonging to every question(s) are scripted and stored in this section. The benefit of keeping the List section separate from the Question section is that one single list can be assigned to more than one question, if required. Example: A list with two options ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ might be required in various questions in a survey. In such a scenario, there is no need to make that list again and again for every question, rather reuse the same list if/when required.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MEDIA</span></tt>: All the media involved in a study i.e Images, Videos etc are saved/stored here and can be used if/when required.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LANGUAGES</span></tt>: This is the section where the font packs of all the languages required in a section are added. However, this section does not translate the text automatically but is only used to integrate the required language font in the survey bundle.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. QUICK TEST</strong></p>
<p><em>This section is used to test the survey while the scripting is in process or has been completed to check how it looks on the Web, Android, and Desktop applications. It’s also used to check the copy and logic of a survey from start to end</em></p>
<div class="section" id="questions">
<h2>2.1. Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/img5.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img5.png" />
<p>This section consist of two sections:</p>
<p><strong>1. Action Selector</strong></p>
<p><em>This has three operations: Add, Save, and Copy</em></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span></tt>: Add is used to add questions in a survey.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Save</span></tt>: This button is used to save the data on the survey creator tool in it’s current state. It’shighly recommended to save data at regular intervals.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Copy</span></tt>: This is used to either copy/duplicate a single question, or a range/set of questions already created on the the the survey creator tool.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Input Form Selector</strong></p>
<p><em>Clicking on the ‘Add’ button shows a dropdown list with few options which are as follows</em>:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Input</span> <span class="pre">Form</span></tt>: Every questions is called an Input-Form which can have multiple input types, as explained in the following sections.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Milestone-Complete</span></tt>: This is the successful completion last page of the survey, which also has a ‘Submit’ button by default.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Milestone–Terminator</span></tt>: This is the unsuccessful completion last page of the survey, which isshown to a respondent in case he/she is screened-out of the survey.</div>
</div>
<img alt="../_images/img6.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img6.png" />
<p><em>On adding a question/input-form, the added /active question is shown in a separate section on the page which is known as the ‘Question Editor Section’. Every single question consists of few components which are as follows</em>:</p>
<p><strong>1. Label &amp; Title</strong>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Labels</span></tt> are the unique identifiers of every single question added in the system. Ex: Q1, Q25a etc.
Please note that the label assigned to a single question cannot be assigned to any other question.
If it is assigned to any other question, it throws a warning <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Duplicate</span> <span class="pre">Label</span></tt>. All the logic of a questionnaire is written referring to Labels. There should not be any spaces in any question label:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Q25 a – Incorrect</div>
<div class="line">Q25a – Correct</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">These labels are also shown on the Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications, as well as the column header in the CSV report file by default. However, column headers of a CSV can be changed later on the reporting dashboard, as explained in the VoxApp Dashboard Usage Guide.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Titles</span></tt> are a sort of stickies assigned to every questions for the scripting team’s reference. Ex: Awareness, TOM, SPONT etc. This is not mandatory, but certainly important as it helps to pin- point a specific question in a long list of questions of any study.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Question Header and Help Text</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Question</span> <span class="pre">Header</span></tt> is the main question text of a question. Ex: ‘Which one of these is your favourite brand?’. Please note, this section also supports basic HTML decorations like &lt;b&gt;, &lt;u&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;img src&gt; etc for Bold, Underline, Italics, Break, Image Source respectively.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Help</span> <span class="pre">Text</span></tt> is the section where special instruction can be added for any question, if any. Ex: ‘Single Answer Only’, ‘Please select only one brand’. Size of the text in this section is smaller than the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Question</span> <span class="pre">Header</span></tt> section. Please note, HTML decoration is not supported in this section.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Languages</strong></p>
<p>This is the section where the translations for every question is added in a study. More detailed description of the same has been given in following sections.</p>
<p><strong>4. Logic Section</strong></p>
<p>This is where the javascript logic like Skipping, Branching, Piping is written for a question. It has two sections: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Question</span> <span class="pre">Loads</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">When</span> <span class="pre">Question</span> <span class="pre">Updates</span></tt>. For logic written in ‘When Question Loads’ section, the logic is evaluated and implemented before a question loads/shown on the application. For logic written in ‘When Question Updates’ section, the logic is evaluated and implemented after a question has loaded/shown on the application, and is evaluated on the basis of inputs given in that specific question.</p>
<img alt="../_images/img7.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img7.png" />
<p>Once a question is created, the next step is to assign a set of choices to that question, and define how those choices are to represented on the application.</p>
<p><strong>1. Input Type Selector</strong></p>
<p>This section is used to define what list of options are to be assigned to a question, and to define how they are to be represented on the application. When you click on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span></tt> button in the Input Type Selector section, a dropdown gives you the available list of input-type choices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Question Selector</strong></p>
<p>Every question added is shown in the question list and can be selected from this section.</p>
<img alt="../_images/img8.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img8.png" />
<p>When an input-type is added to a question, every input type has these components:</p>
<p><strong>1. Input Type &amp; Label</strong></p>
<p><em>This is where the name of the input type is shown. Also, this is where the label of an input type is defined by the individual. ‘Labels’ are the unique identifiers of every single input type added in a survey</em>.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ex: 1, 25a etc(No ‘Q’ should be prefixed to the label of any list). Please note that the label assigned to a single input-type cannot be assigned to any other input-type. If it is assigned to any other input-type, it throws a warning ‘Duplicate Label’. All the logic of a questionnaire is written referring to Labels. There should not be any spaces in any input-type label:</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">25 a – Incorrect</div>
<div class="line">25_a – Correct</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">These labels are also shown on the Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications, as well as the column header in the CSV report file by default.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Input-Type Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>This section is used to define actions on an input-type. Actions are as follows</em>:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Hidden</span></tt>: This action is used to hide or unhide an input-type as per requirement. Ex: In case there is an ‘Other(Please specify)’ option in the answer choices, and when a person clicks on that option, it should ideally show a textbox for entering the specific details. If not selected, textbox should be hidden.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Disabled</span></tt>: This action is used to disable an input type, if required i.e an input-type will be visible to an user on the application but no user action will be allowed on that input-type, if it is ‘Disabled’. This is usually used where answers are auto-coded and it’s only shown to the user for reference.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Allow</span> <span class="pre">Randomize</span></tt>: This action is used to shuffle/randomize order of the answer choices of an input-type. Please note, only the representation is randomised and no change in the code or column position happens using this option.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>3. List Selector</strong></p>
<p><em>This is used to assign a list to an input-type. When clicked on this, it shows a dropdown with the list of all the available lists for that survey</em></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Refresh</span> <span class="pre">List</span></tt>: If a list has been assigned to an input-type and there are changes which are done to that list after it has been assigned, pressing this button will update the list in the input type.</div>
</div>
<img alt="../_images/img9.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img9.png" />
<p><strong>1. List Preview</strong></p>
<p>When a list is assigned to an input type, a preview of the same is shown on the input-type.</p>
<p><strong>2. Validator</strong></p>
<p>Every input-type also has a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Validator</span></tt> section which is used to add basic validation in an input type. Ex: In a choice list input-type, you can define a number of ‘Minimum’ or/and ‘Maximum’ choice(s) that a respondent can select before they are allowed to move ahead in the survey.</p>
<img alt="../_images/img10.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img10.png" />
<p>The above image shows how validators are added in an input-type. Once the validators are also added, the question is deemed as complete, if there is no other javascript logic that is to be added in the survey.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lists">
<h2>2.2. Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#lists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/img11.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img11.png" />

<p><strong>1. Lists</strong></p>
<p>Lists is listed as the second item on the Section Selector and can selected from there.</p>
<p><strong>2. Action Selector</strong></p>
<p><em>This has three operations: Add, Save, and Copy</em></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span></tt>: Add is used to add/create a list.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Save</span></tt>: This button is used to save the data on the list section in it’s current state. It’s highly recommended to save data at regular intervals.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Copy</span></tt>: This is used to either copy/duplicate a single list.</div>

<p><strong>3. List Queue</strong></p>
<p><em>This is ‘List’ queues section where all the lists created are shown</em></p>
<img alt="../_images/img12.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img12.png" />
<p>On adding a list, the added /active list is shown in a separate section on the page which is known as the ‘List Editor Section’. Every single question consists of few components which are as follows:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>2. List Items</strong></p>
<p>This is the section where list items are added(either pasted from a word document or typed in by an individual)</p>
<p><strong>3. Separator</strong></p>
<p>This is a separator section which is used to define a separator between two(or more than two) list elements. Elements of a list can be separated by a new line, comma, or any other custom separator of scriptor’s choice. It’s mandatory to define a separator before hitting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Add</span> <span class="pre">Item(s)</span></tt> button.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Example:</div>
</div>
<img alt="../_images/img13.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img13.png" />
<p>In this, ‘1’ is the label of the list, ‘BrandList’ is the title of the list, ‘A,B,C,D,E, None of these’ are the elements of the list, and ‘New Line’ is the separator defined for this list.</p>
<img alt="../_images/img14.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img14.png" />
<p>When ‘Add Item(s)’ is clicked, the items of a list are split into separate entities as per the defined separator. Every item of a list has the following components:</p>
<p><strong>1. List Item Label</strong></p>
<p>This is unique identifier of a single item within a list. Please note that the label assigned to a single list item cannot be assigned to any other list item within a list. If it is assigned to any other list item within a list, it throws a warning ‘Duplicate Label’. All the logic of a questionnaire is written referring to Labels.
| There should not be any spaces in any list label:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>| 1 1 – Incorrect
| 1_1 – Correct
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. List Item Name</strong></p>
<p>This is the name of the list items which is defined by the individual.</p>
<p><strong>3. Image</strong></p>
<p>This section is used to assign an image already present in the Media section of the survey(explained in the following sections) to a list item. Ex: In case of Brand Names, relevantbrand logo/image can be assigned to an item.</p>
<p><strong>4. Code</strong></p>
<p>These are the codes assigned to every item of a list which is used to represent that element in a CSV/report file.</p>
<p><strong>5. Veto</strong></p>
<p>This option is assigned to an element, which when selected, deselects every other option selected previously. Ex: If ‘None of These’ is marked as veto, and when this selected in a question, every other option of that list if selected previously, gets deselcted automatically.</p>
<img alt="../_images/img15.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/img15.png" />

<p>This is the third item in the Section Selector. This section is used to add media like Images,Videos, Audio files etc to the survey. This has two components:</p>
<p><strong>1. Upload a file</strong></p>
<p>This is used to upload the media from a local machine to the cloud and the survey. There is no limit on the media being uploaded, but as per the cardinal rule, lesser the media, better the performance of a survey on various devices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Generate Asset</strong></p>
<p>Everytime a new media file is added in a survey, this button should be pressed to re-generate the assests in the survey bundle/package.</p>
